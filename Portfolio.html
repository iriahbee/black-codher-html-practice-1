<p> My name is Solagne, however I go by Riah, most of the time.

    I've been interested in the Tech space for a long time and I've finally made a proper leap in to it.
    
    I started a business 2020 'Purple Virtual' and my professional background is in digital media, project management and operations. All services I now offer as a Virtual Assistant.
    
    I know. Nothing at all to do with my law degree. 
    
    I'm a solutions oriented person however and I enjoy planning.
    
    I'm hoping to develop an App, for obvious reasons I can't say what it is but I'm really interest in augmented reality and how I can use it in my business and to help my clients achieve their goals.
    
    In the future I'd like to be able to empower young women like myself from developing countries through tech and digital media, in line with the sustainable development goals from the UN.
    
    May the force be with me or whatever they say in Star Wars.
    
    Okay Bye!!! </p>
