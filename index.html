    <h2>Who is crazier Joe or Love?</h2>

  <p>
    Netflix’s dark, stalker-narrated murder drama You has often been messy, and
    typically been compelling. Its lead character, Joe Goldberg, is a monster in
    the guise of a particularly thoughtful boyfriend, and while Penn Badgley’s
    perfect, rapturously obsessive performance is the driving force of the
    series, something about You has always made it seem like it’s tap-dancing
    over the story’s soft spots, trying to create the impression of momentum
    even when it’s staying in one place. Now returning for a third season, You
    is the best it’s ever been — every bit as dark and stinging and cheerfully
    willing to screw with its audience, but now outfitted with a glorious foil
    for Joe’s monstrousness.
